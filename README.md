# Developer-Portfolio
Created my developer portfolio using React, Framer Motion, NodeJS, and deployed with Vercel

## Future Updates

To make changes and update the portfolio in the future, follow these steps:

1. **Make Changes Locally**  
   Open the project folder in VS Code and edit your React components, styles, content, or add new projects.

2. **Test Locally**  
   Run the development server to preview changes live:  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
3. **Build for Production**

   Once satisfied with the changes, create an optimized production build:

   ```bash
   npm run build

4. Commit and push changes to the main branch:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your changes"
   git push origin main
