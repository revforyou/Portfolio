# Developer-Portfolio
This is a fully responsive, modern, and animated developer portfolio built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## Future Updates

To make changes and update the portfolio in the future, follow these steps:

1. **Make Changes Locally**  
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   
Open the project folder in VS Code and edit your React components, styles, content, or add new projects.

3. **Test Locally**  
   Run the development server to preview changes live:  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
4. **Build for Production**

   Once satisfied with the changes, create an optimized production build:

   ```bash
   npm run build

5. Commit and push changes to the main branch:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your changes"
   git push origin main
